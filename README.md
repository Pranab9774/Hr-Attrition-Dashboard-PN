Insights Summary
High-performing employees with Master's degrees are quitting more, possibly a sign of internal engagement or pay problems.

Sales and tech positions experience more attrition, which may signify potential job tension or outside possibilities.

Attrition is greater among those who rarely travel, which suggests limited experience or discontent.

Mid-career employees (26-50) are the most likely to leave, possibly due to better market opportunities.
